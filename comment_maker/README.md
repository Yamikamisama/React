# Comment Maker

This was a tutorial that Facebook gives to get started with React, If you would like to play with the comment box you will need to run it on a server.

#####Clone the repo
```
git clone [RepoPath]
```

#####To use a ruby server, run this command in terminal:
```
ruby server.rb
```

#####To use a node server, run this command in terminal:
```
npm install
node server.js
```

The server will be running on localhost:3000

Have fun and I hope this helps!
